# Laravel with FusionAuth Example

This app is an example Laravel application. It delegates user management, registration and login to FusionAuth. It uses a middleware to ensure that only signed in users can access certain pages.

Read more about how to set this up and run it [HERE](https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/06/03/user-registration-and-sign-in-with-laravel).

## Setting up this rep
